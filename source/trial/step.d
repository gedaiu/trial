  When you run complex tests, or tests that take a lot of time, it helps
  to mark certain areas as steps, to ease the debug or to improve the report.

  A good usage is for running BDD tests where a step can be steps from the
  `Gherkin Syntax` or UI Automation tests.

/** A step structure. Creating a Step will automatically be added to the current step as a child
  * The steps can be nested to allow you to group steps as with meanigful names.
  *
  * The steps ends when the Struct is destroyed. In order to have a step that represents a method
  * assign it to a local variable
  *
  * Examples:
  * ------------------------
  * void TestSetup() @system
  * {
  *   auto aStep = Step("Given some precondition");
  *
  *   Step("Some setup");
  *   performSomeSetup();
  *
  *   Step("Other setup");
  *   performOtherSetup();
  * }
  * // will create this tree:
  * // Test
  * //  |
  * //  +- Given some precondition
  * //        |
  * //        +- Some setup
  * //        +- Other setup
